//CHAPTER-2 JAVASCRIPT RUNTIME ENVIORNMENTS

/* A. JAVASCRIPT RUN-TIME ENVIORNMENT

1. The JavaScript runtime environment is the environment in which JavaScript code is executed. 

2. It consists of several components that work together to execute JavaScript code. These 
   environments can vary depending on the context in which JavaScript is being run. Here are 
   some common types of JavaScript runtime environments:

   a) Browsers: Browsers are the most common JavaScript runtime environments. They include Chrome, 
      Firefox, Safari, and others. Browsers provide a JavaScript runtime environment that allows 
      JavaScript code to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM), handle events, make network 
      requests, and manipulate the webpage using different API's.

   b) Node.js: Node.js is a popular JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows
      JavaScript code to be executed on the server-side.
      We have to discuss only these two (a) and (b) as a Web Developer.

   c) Embedded JavaScript Runtimes: Some software applications embed JavaScript runtimes to provide
      scripting capabilities. For example, Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Creative Suite applications use 
      JavaScript as a scripting language.

   d) Desktop Applications: Some desktop applications, such as Electron-based applications, utilize
      JavaScript as a primary scripting language. These environments allow developers to build cross
      -platform desktop applications using web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

   e) Mobile Applications: Mobile applications built using frameworks like React Native and NativeScript
      leverage JavaScript as a primary language for building cross-platform mobile applications.

   f) IoT Devices and Embedded Systems: Some IoT devices and embedded systems support JavaScript as a 
      scripting language. */
