//CHAPTER-3 REACT JSX

/* A. WHAT IS JSX?
  1. JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML in JavaScript returning React Element. 
  2. Using JSX we place HTML Elements in the DOM without any createElement() and/or appendChild() methods.
  3. We are not required to use JSX, but JSX makes it easier to write React applications. Without using
     JSX, we would have to create an element by the following process: Refer index.jsx */



/* B. JSX EXPRESSION
  1. With JSX you can write JS Expressions inside curly braces {}. 
  2. The expression can be a JS Variable, or Property, or any other valid JavaScript Expression. JSX will 
     execute the expression and return the result. Refer App.jsx  */



/* C. SYNTAX AND MULTIPLE LINES INSERTION 
  1. To write JSX in React use () to write multiple lines. To write HTML MULTIPLE ELEMENTS put the HTML
     inside <>HERE</>. Refer: App.jsx
  2. JSX follows XML rules, and therefore HTML elements must be properly closed. */



/* D. HTML ATTRIBUTES NAME NOT SUPPORTED BY JSX
  1. class → className
  2. for → htmlFor
  3. style → style object
  4. tabindex → tabIndex
  5. autofocus → autoFocus
  6. allowfullscreen → allowFullScreen
  7. frameborder → frameBorder
  8. maxlength → maxLength
  9. readonly → readOnly
  10. contenteditable → contentEditable */



/* E. CONDITIONAL STATEMENT NOT VALID 
  1. React supports if statements, but not inside JSX.
  2. To be able to use conditional statements in JSX, you should put the if statements outside of the JSX,
     or you could use a ternary expression instead. */
