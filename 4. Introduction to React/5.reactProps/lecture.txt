//CHAPTER-6 REACT PROPS

/* A. REACT PROPS
  1. Props stands for properties. They are used for passing data from one component to the other one.
  
  2. React Props are like Formal Arguments when they are passed as Argument in JavaScript and 
     React Prop's Value is passed when the function/component is called in the Parent Function. */




/* B. WHAT IS PROP DRILLING?
  1. Sometimes while developing React applications, there is a need to pass data from a component that
     is higher in the hierarchy to a component that is deeply nested.
     
  2. To pass data between such components, we pass props from a source component and keep passing the 
     prop to the next component in the hierarchy till we reach the deeply nested component, where it 
     has to be atually used.
     
  3. The main disadvantage of prop drilling in React is that it can make the code harder to manage and
     maintain, especially in large applications with deeply nested components.
     
  4. Intermediate components become cluttered with props they don't use directly, making the code harder 
     to read and understand. */




/* C.HOW TO PASS DATA BETWEEN COMPONENTS
   1. Parent Component to Child Component- With the help of props, we can send data from a parent to a
      child component.
      
   2. Child Component to Parent Component- Create a callback in the parent component which takes in the
      data needed as a parameter. Pass this callback as a prop to the child component. Send data from 
      the child component using the callback. Refer-Parent.jsx and Child.jsx
      
   3. Sibling Components- Context API and Redux are the standard ways to share data between siblings.
      Some more procedures are Lifting State Up, Custom Event Bus, React Router.
      - Lifting State Up- Create the shared state to the nearest common ancestor component. Pass the state
        and setter functions as props to the children. */
